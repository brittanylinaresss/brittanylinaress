# Hi, I'm Brittany Linares

I'm currently part of the AI Studio 2025 program, where I'm building hands-on experience in machine learning and data science. I’m especially interested in using data and code to solve meaningful problems, and I enjoy working on projects that push my skills forward.

Right now, I’m focused on improving my ML model-building skills, collaborating on group projects, and staying active in the open-source community. Whether it's exploring new algorithms or cleaning up messy datasets, I love the process of building something useful from scratch.

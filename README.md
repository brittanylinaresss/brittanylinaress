# Hi, I'm Brittany Linares

I'm currently part of the AI Studio 2025 program, where I'm building hands-on experience in machine learning and data science. I’m especially interested in using data and code to solve meaningful problems, and I enjoy working on projects that push my skills forward.

Right now, I’m focused on improving my ML model-building skills, collaborating on group projects, and staying active in the open-source community. Whether it's exploring new algorithms or cleaning up messy datasets, I love the process of building something useful from scratch.

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on recently:

### [income-classification-census](https://github.com/brittanylinaresss/My-eCornell-Portfolio-/blob/main/Lab8.DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb?short_path=eb7038a)

A machine learning project that uses census data to predict whether a person earns more than $50K annually.  
Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and comparison of multiple models like logistic regression and gradient boosting.
### [Lab-8-digit-classification](https://github.com/brittanylinaresss/My-eCornell-Portfolio-/blob/main/ImplementCNN.ipynb) 
Digit Classification from 0-9
